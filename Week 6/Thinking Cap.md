# What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
A map presented alone is stagnant and unchanging. There is little room to draw conclusions or to build imaginaries from a plain map. Even with light data added, a map 
can be difficult to interpret in ways outside of the data that the maker wants you to. Thick mapping expands on what a map can be and what it ought to do. Thick maps 
are infused with meaning through narrative, history, and data. They are always changing as current information is built upon. Thick mapping ideally will allow users to
build their own meanings and to interpret the map differently than another user. 

I really like the idea of thick mapping. I believe that while the "openness" of thick mapping may at times leave too much room open for interpretation, that 
it is a valuable way for us to present environmental data and to present historical events. So while you might not want to use this method if you are hoping to push a 
specific conclusion, thick mapping is very valuable when presenting the larger effects of an event. Thick mapping allows for maps to be presented along with more 
narrative elements. Thinking specifically to one of the examples mentioned in the preface, being able to present a map of Historic Filipinotown along with personal
accounts and videos would imbue the map with so much more humanity than just a map of the area, or even a map presenting quantitative data on the area. 

# How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?
Thick mapping is such an excellent method for integrating human elements into the quantitative data of a map. As someone interested in how maps can help social causes,
thick mapping seems to me to be an excellent way to look past the data and to see the people behind it. It can be really easy to forget that there are lives (people,
animals, and plants) that are represented in the statistics. Thick mapping pushes for us to remember that the lives are not separate from the data and that both are 
important. 

I think that my group's project (Enviromental Racism in Carceral California) would be so much more impactful if we could include prisoner testimonies on the prison 
conditions in addition to our featured stories. If we had the time and resources to do this, I think that our map would be a lot more illuminating.
