# Reflections 
I feel like good UXD is like any other piece of infrastructure: it's only noticeable when it's bad. When UX is well designed, you don't even think about how easy and convenient everything is. 

Ralph mentions how important it is to engage with users from the very beginning when designing UX. I think it's particularly important to engage with disabled users. Disabled users will be able to point out flaws that are inconvenient to most users, but present complete barriers to them. For example, many of the websites used to book vaccine appointments are difficult for low-vision users to read and don't function easily with screen readers. Working with vision-impaired users during design would have made the websites more useable by all users. 

I have a friend who works in UXD that fights to include disabled voices in the design process. They have told me that whatever the effort they have to expend in order to make a design fully accessible in the beginning is a lot lower than the effort it takes to make the design accessible later on. Kind of like how it's easier to design a building that is accessible to begin with than it is to add in ramps and elevators later after the building is already finished. 

## Questions for Alesha
1. Are there any unique challenges in UXD for AR/VR compared to other things? I'm not able to use VR technology really because it makes me feel motion sick and the goggles rarely accomodate my glasses. 
2. How do you incorporate accessibility into your designs?
