### Site's Agenda
The atlas allows user to see areas in the United States where grocery stores are scarce or hard to get to. 

### Why the website speaks to me
I'm interested in food justice and so have drawn on USDA data for my research. This map is helpful in visualizing neighborhoods and regions where there is a greater need for food justice initiatives. 

### How does the map work? 
The map uses census data to determine areas of low income, and lists of supermarkets to determine the distance of a census tract to the nearest grocery store. The map uses 1/2-1 mile indicators for urban areas and 10-20 mile indicators for rural areas to determine if a particular census tract qualifies as a food desert. 

### What technology is used?
The map uses the Environmental Systems Research Inc. (ESRI) ArcGIS server technology. 

### What would I change? 
Though the USDA indicates that the maps were updated in December, 2020, it feels out of date. I would like to see additional sources of information added to those already being used in order to make the information feel more up-to-date. I would also like a way to visualize the actual locations of the supermarkets/grocery stores. I think this would help in visualizing the actual distance between the food deserts and sources of nutritious foods.
